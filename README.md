## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- Built in Vistual Studio Code

### What I learned

With this challenge, i learned how to manipulate and stylize UL and OL. I learned too how to deal with tables and responsive designs

I'm proud that a i learned how we can deal with the bullets of a list. Look below:

```css
.ingredients__list li {
    list-style: disc outside none; /* This line select the type of a list and change, in order as appear, the type of bullet, his position and image */
}

.ingredients__list li::marker {
    color: var(--nutmeg); /* Selecting the list marker, you can change the color of a bullet without change the color of the text */
}
```
